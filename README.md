# Introduction to Multilayer Neural Networks with KERAS
##### Introduction to  KERAS
- Keras is an API that sits on top of Google’s TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK), and other machine learning frameworks. The goal is to have a single API to work with all of those and to make that work easier.
- Keras is a high-level API for building neural networks that run on top of TensorFlow, Theano or CNTK. It allows for rapid prototyping, supports both recurrent and convolutional neural networks and runs on either your CPU or GPU for increased speed.

Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:
- Allows for easy and fast prototyping (through user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility).
- Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
- Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.

##### Multilayer Perceptrons
- Multilayer feedforward neural networks are a special type of fully connectednetwork with multiple single neurons. They are also called Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP). The following figure illustrates the concept of an MLP consisting of three layers
